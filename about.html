              <P>In the twilight Zone of life's National average, if lam asked "what is my drive to be centenarian batsman" My answer is, "In the inning I have played so far, I was bowled caught behind LBW. Run out and all that, yet I played the game for my living, the drive was not survival but seeking Knowledge, for myself, for my society and for my nation.
                <br>
                On medium which I understood for acquisition and distribution of knowledge is GRADUATION. Our nation needs graduation of value, today more than any other time in history. The graduation Education has its price, it is inevitable but it should be based on value too. We at Sanghamitra Degree & PG. College affiliated to Omonia University are creating a blend of the two and offering it at an affordable prices to the students.</P>

                <h2>Principal<br>Shri S N Meeravali</h2>
            <p>Education is a prime instrument of national purpose and that quality of education is inescapably involved in the quality of nation. The maintenance and strengthening of quality education is a task even more cumbersome than its attainment. What is required is an immense burst of idealism among our students, who must be thoroughly devoted to the task of safeguarding this great honour of ours, founded on quality and commitment.<br>True Education is that which teaches one to learn, unlearn and releam, so as to become fine human beings and contribute positively to the society. The quest for excellence has assumed paramount importance not only in the field of academic achievements but also in leadership qualities. I can see the brighter future for it with deeply committed management, with the dedicated efforts of our staff, involved parents and most of all intelligent and sensitive students. We shall continue to attain our two fold mission to provide quality education and character development of our children.</P>
